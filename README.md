Title: Covid-19 Vaccine Analysis using IBM Cognos
\


 Overview:
This project involves the analysis of global Covid-19 vaccination progress using the IBM Cognos analytics platform and Python. The objective is to gain insights into vaccination trends, disparities, and effectiveness, leveraging the dataset available on Kaggle.




 Project Details


- Dataset: The primary data source for this analysis is the "Covid-19 World Vaccination Progress" dataset, which can be accessed from, (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress).


- Language: The analysis involves Python scripts for data preprocessing and possibly integration with IBM Cognos for visualization and reporting.






 Dependencies


To run the Python scripts and potentially integrate with IBM Cognos, you will need the following dependencies:


- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for data preprocessing)
- Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- IBM Cognos Analytics


You can install the Python libraries using `pip` or `conda`:
